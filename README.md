Sudoku is a puzzle game where the goal is to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all the numbers from 1 to 9. Each number can only appear once in each row, column, and subgrid. The puzzle starts with some numbers already filled in and the player has to use logic and deduction to fill in the remaining cells.

This Java Sudoku application is a computer program that is written in the Java programming language and implements the game of Sudoku. It allows the user to play and solve Sudoku puzzles. The application typically includes a user-friendly interface for entering and displaying the puzzle.

In order to actually build and launch this project, you will need to configure some kind of build tool. I have included the build.gradle and settings.gradle files, which should allow you to set the project up using Gradle, should that be your preferred tool. 

The easiest solution would be to create a new Gradle project in your preferred IDE, and then copy and paste the source files, and the gradle files form this repo over to the new project.
